# Claims Denial Reduction Strategy
This project analyzes Medicare claims data using SQL, Excel, and Tableau to identify approval rates, common errors, and provider performance.

Business Problem :
This project focuses on analyzing Medicare claims data to identify common errors, provider performance, and claim approval trends. The goal is to improve claim processing efficiency and reduce unnecessary denials.

Key Insights from the Analysis

Claim Approval vs. Denial Rate
81.19% of claims were approved ("Agree"), while 18.81% were denied ("Disagree").
The high approval rate suggests that most claims meet Medicare guidelines, but a significant portion still gets rejected.

Top 10 Most Common Error Codes
"Insufficient Documentation" was the leading reason for claim errors, with 4,377 occurrences.
Other common errors include "Incorrect Coding" (2,264) and "Overturned" (1,684).
Addressing documentation issues could significantly reduce claim denials.

Provider Performance Analysis
Clinical Laboratories had the highest number of claims (3,764), followed by Ambulance Services (423) and Ambulatory Surgical Centers (275).
Some provider types had very few claims, such as Certified Nurse Midwives (1) and Anesthesiologist Assistants (1).
This insight helps identify which provider types contribute the most to Medicare claims.
